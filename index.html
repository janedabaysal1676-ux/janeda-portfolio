  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Janeda Baysal and I am 23 years old. I completed my BSc in 
      <strong>Geomatics Engineering</strong> at Yıldız Technical University in Istanbul, where I developed a strong
      interest in mapping, surveying and spatial data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am studying in the <strong>Copernicus Master in Digital Earth</strong> programme at the University of Salzburg.
      My main interests are GIS, remote sensing, earth observation, risk mapping and geospatial solutions for humanitarian
      and environmental challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting my master, I worked in a construction/mapping company in Turkey, where I was involved in
      land surveying, GNSS and total station measurements, cadastral tasks and map production. I enjoy combining
      technical skills with clear communication and visual storytelling.
