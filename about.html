  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Janeda Baysal and I am 23 years old. I completed my BSc in 
    <strong>Geomatics Engineering</strong> at Yıldız Technical University in Istanbul, where I developed a strong
    interest in mapping, surveying and spatial data analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am studying in the <strong>Copernicus Master in Digital Earth</strong> programme at the University of Salzburg.
    My main interests are GIS, remote sensing, earth observation, risk mapping and geospatial solutions for humanitarian
    and environmental challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before starting my master, I worked in a construction/mapping company in Turkey, where I was involved in
    land surveying, GNSS and total station measurements, cadastral tasks and map production. I enjoy combining
    technical skills with clear communication and visual storytelling.
